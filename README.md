# Simple_Calculator

# Overview

I created a simple calculator in C# using winform. This software demostrates the use of variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and structures in C#. It also showcases the versatility of the winform gui. My main goal in this was to experiement with C# and see how different the syntax is from other languages that I have learned.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
